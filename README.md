## ⚡ What is SPEKTR?

SPEKTR is a precision instrument for your terminal. It recursively scans your development workspaces to identify heavy build artifacts (`node_modules`, `target`, `build`, etc.) and lets you "jettison" gigabytes of digital waste in seconds.

Built in **Rust** 🦀, it is multi-threaded, memory-safe, and designed to handle monorepos with 50,000+ folders without breaking a sweat.

## 🚀 Features

- **Blazing Fast Scans:** Powered by `jwalk` for parallel directory traversal. Scans gigabytes in milliseconds.
- **Mission Control TUI:** A beautiful 3-pane interface built with `ratatui`.
- **Smart Detection:** Context-aware scanning (only deletes `node_modules` if `package.json` exists).
- **Safety First:** "Dry Run" by default. Confirmation modals prevent accidental nukes.

> [!CAUTION] > **Use responsibly.** Running this tool on your root directory (`/` or `C:\`) is NOT recommended. While SPEKTR detects projects safely, accidental deletion of critical system files is always a risk with any cleaning tool. Stick to your development workspaces (e.g., `~/code`, `~/projects`).

- **Developer Focused:** Filter by project type (Node, Rust, Flutter, Android).
- **Deep Clean:** Handles nested monorepos and workspaces with ease.

## 📦 Installation

### ⚡ Quick Install (Recommended)

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcyrus/spektr/main/install.sh | bash

```

### Scan-Only Mode (Headless)

Good for quick checks or CI environments.

```bash
spektr --mode scan ~/code/work

```
